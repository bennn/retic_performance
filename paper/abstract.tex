Strageties for evaluating gradual typing function:
- Use random sampling (mix up every function)
- Function level
- module level (already have configs)


Methodology:
- program to generate all possible configurations on a function level for each benchmark
- methodoloy for random sampling ???????
- Benchmarks ran on ..????????
XF

Analysis:
- for each function f, consider all configs in which f is typed vs all functions in which f is untyped
- look for one function at a time????????
- RSM 
- scatter plots (compare types to the running time)
- line plots (compare configs to the untyped PYTHON program - overhead)
