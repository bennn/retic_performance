Observations

1. As previously mentioned on the group email - the assigning of a
   tuple to a list (or subsection of a list) is valid python code but
   not currently accepted by the typechecker since List <> Tuple.

2. Using "Int" in typing annotations works fine in reticulated, but
   now it wont run using vanilla python since Int is not defined there
   (I believe this is already a known bug/issue, but just wanted to
   note just in case)
