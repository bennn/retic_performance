Observations

1. The first go around worked (incorrectly) because of a bug in reticulated 
which allowed unrecognized types (Bytes, at the time, was not a type, I 
believe). Anyway, I started from scratch and typed the whole thing - 
it went very smoothly. Nothing abnormal or overly interesting to report.
