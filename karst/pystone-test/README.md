pystone-test
===

Ran the `pystone` benchmark 20 times via 20 cluster jobs.

Results were UNIFORM across jobs. Very good.
Took `0.49 -- 0.51` seconds to run the benchmark.

That's nice to hear.


### Summary
- `pystone-data.tar.gz` raw data from the cluster
- `pystone-results.txt` spreadsheet of pystones/second
